# Coffee Catch

An endless runner game made in 3 days for the Solo Game Jam 2025 Hosted by RaphaÃ«l Miller.
I used a lot of open source assets so its only fair that i give back someway and make the entire project open source,
Although im not a good programmer still so i doubt this will be of use for anyone.
